 So hard life is .And so good it'll be if I'm quite healthy.
I must be healthy.<!--more-->

And staying up late is not good for that.

I think sometimes my bad feelings come from a sense of embarassment.


But it's just your own matter,and others,noe one will feel even a little about that.
So you can just delete it.And pay more attention on the things themselves.

Hope you feel better,and be happier every day.
