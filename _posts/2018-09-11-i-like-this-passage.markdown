Your 20s will produce more failures than you’ll choose to remember. The key is when you fail, don’t begin calling yourself a failure.
The possibility for greatness and embarrassment both exist in the same space. If you’re not willing to be embarrassed, you’re probably not willing to be great.

The difference between successful people and failures is that they make a habit of doing the things that failures don't like to do.Successful people
do things that are hard and necessary and important.Unsuccessful people ,
on the other hand, do the things that are fun and easy and which give immediate enjoyment.
