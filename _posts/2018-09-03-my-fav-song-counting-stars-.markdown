Lately I've been，I've been losing sleep
最近我辗转反侧
<!--more-->
Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
梦想着我们的愿景

But baby I been, I been prayin' hard
但亲爱的 我一直在努力祈祷

Said no more counting dollars
不再财迷心窍

We'll be counting stars
数钱不如数星星

Yeah, we'll be counting stars
没错 我们一起来数星星

I see this life
最近生活

Like a swinging vine
如一团乱麻

Swing my heart across the line
让我无所适从

In my faces flashing suns
脸上闪过各种迹象

Seek it out and ye shall find
遍寻之后 你会发现

Old, but I'm not that old
我成熟 但没那么老练

Young, but I'm not that bold
我年轻 却不那么鲁莽

And I don't think the world is sold
我不认为这个世界无药可救

I'm just doing what we're told
我只是循规蹈矩地为人处事

I, feel something so right
虽知何为中正

But doing the wrong thing
却又离经叛道

I, feel something so wrong
虽知何处污浊

But doing the right thing
却又随波逐流

I could lie, could lie, could lie
我无法自欺欺人

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
所有的绝地 都使我逢生

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
最近我辗转反侧

Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
梦想着我们的愿景

Baby I been, I been prayin' hard
但亲爱的 我一直在努力祈祷

Said no more counting dollars
别再财迷心窍

We'll be counting stars
我们一起数星星

I feel the love
我感觉爱

And I feel it burn
就在胸膛燃烧

Down this river every turn
如同潺潺流水 蜿蜒曲折

Hope is a four letter word
“希望”不过是个低俗字眼（亵玩之意）

Make that money
把它变为金钱

Watch it burn
看着它燃尽

Old, but I'm not that old
我成熟 但没那么老练

Young, but I'm not that bold

And I don't think the world is sold

Take that money
身外之物
And watch it burn
皆可抛
Sink in the river
将其沉河
The lessons I learned
已受教
Take that money
身外之物
And watch it burn
皆可抛
Sink in the river
将其沉河
The lessons I learned
已受教

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
沉舟侧畔千帆过 病树前头万木春

Lately I been, I been losing sleep
最近我辗转反侧

Dreaming 'bout the things that we could be
梦想着我们的愿景
