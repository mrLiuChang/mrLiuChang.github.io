<p>
If you mistake the excerpt_separator for excerpt,then the outlook will not show
the excerpt of the assay.<!--more-->
</p>
Also if your permalink is confict with some one in your remote repo in your github.
Then this page will not show on your website.
<p>
Pay attention to that post variable doesn't have categories or category asset.So avoid
use it like this.Forloop and if check are all very useful for one website.
