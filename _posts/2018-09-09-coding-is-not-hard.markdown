Sometimes we all tend to believe in some other powerful men's words.
We think that it' truth,because these words come from the successful.
This just shows your lack of self-confidence.
You do not need to have doubt in yourself any more.
Beacuse you are so wise that you can think all the things you meet
dependently,and you thought and your judge is correct!

Coding is not hard.Coding is just like a game.A very attracting game.
You can stand up on a very high level if you try your best to expand your
imagination and knowledge.
