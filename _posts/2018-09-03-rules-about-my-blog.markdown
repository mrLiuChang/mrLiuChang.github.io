<p>Firstly.less is more,less pictures,less other contents,just use your own words
to express,to record,and to dream.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Secondly,always keep the homepage clean and in simplisity.</p>
<p>This is definitly a blog about technology,so write more.</p>
<p>Finally,To be true and to be objective when writing logs,never be emotional in your log.
Don't write in your useless plans,but do more records about the things that you have completely finished.</p>
<p>Use English whenever</p>
